## Not sure if the hashing method I implemented is what she asked for. I basically hash the password as soon as the input box is out of focus.

## I got rid of the email feature so it is easier to implement (probably does not really make a difference).

## I added 2 validate JSP to redirect on form submission, not sure if this is the best way to do.

## I was not able to ssh to the server for now due to some pem key issue.
